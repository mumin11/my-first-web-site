    HTML is a command that defines the size</a>, color, shape, graphics, 
    and movement of documents (hyperlinks) of a document and is used to 
    <strong>create a <u>homepage</u> </strong> . The command used in HTML is called a tag, and it is 
    represented by a bracket "". In general, tags are made up of two pairs 
    indicating the beginning and the end, but sometimes only the start tag shows
     the effect,such as tags such as "img" and "br", and the name of the end tag 
     starts with a slash character [/]. In this way, documents written in HTML
     are called HTML documents,and web browsers interpret the documents written 
     in HTML and show them to users.
